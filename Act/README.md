## Finding & Recommendation

To bring this back to a full circle, let's just refer back to our Ask section and take a look at our business task again.

> How can we design data-driven marketing strategies to effectively convert casual members into annual members

Based on my observation and finding, this is what I've come up with.

### Summary
Currently what’s deterring casual from converting to annual is that they don’t use the bike often enough as compared to members. And if they were to use the bike, they tend to ride longer duration as compared to members. (Member has 45min of unlimited rides)

Based on the business tasks, findings and observation from the data. This is the top 3 recommendation I have come up with. While crafting the recommendation, I also take into consideration the negative impact that might occur and try to mitigate whenever possible.

### Recommendation
1. A new sign up offers for casual, where for the first 3 months, they get to enjoy longer unlimited rides up to 1 hour. 

2. A new sign up offers for casual, where for the first 3 months, they get to choose either unlimited e-bike rides up to 30 minutes or the classic bike for 45 minutes. 

Reason: The reason for the first 2 recommendations is because casual riders tend to ride longer than members or are more open to choosing e-bike, hence by offering them longer ride time for the first 3 months or an option to opt for e-bike, this might encourage them to sign up to be members. This also at the same time brings no negative impact to the rest of the riders. These new sign up offers should be released during April, to be able to catch the casual rider crowd (May to August).

3. A new membership offering a limited number of rides per week but with a longer ride duration. 

Reason: This might entice casual since they fit into this profile of lesser ride counts, but longer ride duration.

...And With that we have come to the end of the case study.
